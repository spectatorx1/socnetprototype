Social network prototype web app

This is my first attempt of creating something useful with Laravel Framework.


Technologies:
- Laravel 5.4
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- PHP 7
- JavaScript
- Ajax
- CSS
- HTML
- JSON

Available functionality:
- registration
- log in
- option to create post
- view of posts created by logged in user and other users
- access to dashboard is protected and only logged in users can view dashboard
- every post can be "Liked" or "Disliked", edited and deleted (edition and deletion are protected, one user can't delete or edit posts of other users)
- option to change user profile image
- log off
